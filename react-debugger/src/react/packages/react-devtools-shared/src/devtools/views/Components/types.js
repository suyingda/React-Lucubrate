// Each element on the frontend corresponds to a Fiber on the backend.
// Some of its information (e.g. id, type, displayName) come from the backend.
// Other bits (e.g. weight and depth) are computed on the frontend for windowing and display purposes.
// Elements are updated on a push basisâ€“ meaning the backend pushes updates to the frontend when needed.
